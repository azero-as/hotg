# Heroes of the Gym

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the project you have to make sure you have installed all the prerequisites. 

#### SDK
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)


#### Development tools
* Code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Depending on what device you want to use during development, you need either one or both of these tools: 
* Android devices: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* iOS devices: [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

Once you have installed either one or both you need to create a device simulator.
* [How to create an Android device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)


#### Cloud Functions
For writing and deploying Google Cloud Functions, you'll need node.js and FirebaseCLI.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* To install FirebaseCLI, run: ```npm install -g firebase-tools```.

For more information about Cloud Functions, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started. 


### Installing
Open a terminal window and clone the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:marose14/heroes.git

Open the repository in your code editor. Install the necessary packages by running:

```
flutter packages get
```

Make sure a simulator is connected and running. cd to the folder heroes_app and start the project by running:

```
flutter run
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
